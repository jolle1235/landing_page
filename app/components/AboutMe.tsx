      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        I am a newly graduated software engineer with a calm and curious
        mindset, a strong drive to learn, and a passion for building robust,
        user-centered digital solutions. My focus is on writing clean, modular,
        and maintainable code, designing intuitive interfaces, and ensuring that
        applications perform well at scale. I see every project as an
        opportunity to deepen my expertise across both frontend and backend
        technologies while contributing to high-quality, impactful products.
        Outside of development, I live with my partner Cecilie and enjoy playing
        music, both with my band and on the piano. I am also an enthusiastic
        board game player â€” a hobby that mirrors my professional interests in
        strategy, problem-solving, and collaboration.
